toDo/problem list:
check page 10. On the chance that their are three half steps inbetween, sometimes notes will blend together
ties cross over parts
notes could potentially cross over onto the wrong clef if they go too high or too low in two clefs
sharps and naturals potential overlap: need to stagger them
change dotted label if nessecary
