# Sound
Program that analyzes songs, uses a Mark V Shaney Chain to create new songs, and then Javax.sound file to play the songs created. The goal: to create a Spotify song with a push of a button! This is currently a work in progress and has a multitude of parts which don't have comments (still adding them in), but for those who are investigating this code, here's what you need to know:
Read the comments in Main2. It will tell you how to operate and use the program. You may need to add in your own songs in a file that you create to get it to work. The songs have to be in wav format to allow the program to analyze the bytes. I recommend that the youtube clip be up to 1 hour long max, although you can analyze different clips at the same time.
You may have to create your own folders for the song inputs and outputs.
A big portion of this code was possibly thanks to a multitude of people who had helpful insights online. On the top of my files includes links to every resources I used, so if you want more info about how each part works, just follow it.
